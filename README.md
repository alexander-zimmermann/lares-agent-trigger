# lares-agent-trigger

The service that decides when the house explains itself.

It reads the episode events [lares-diagnostics-engine](https://github.com/alexander-zimmermann/lares-diagnostics-engine) publishes on NATS, decides against a declared use-case file whether an event deserves an answer, starts a run on the [Hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) harness, waits for it, and writes the result into one row of the agent ledger.

Besides the chat and the harness's own cron, this is the only thing that starts an agent run — and the only writer of `agent_runs`.

## Why a service and not a job

An LLM run is expensive, slow and easy to start twice. Three decisions have to be made before a model is ever asked, and none of them belongs in a prompt:

- **Is this worth explaining?** The declared filter answers it: an episode that opens at severity 2 or rises is explained, one that ended is not.
- **Has it been explained already?** The ledger's unique key on `(use_case, subject_kind, subject_key)` answers it, with the event kind inside the subject key after the colon (`15510:escalated`). The row is written *before* the run is started, so a redelivered message finds the key taken and stops there. One event can never become two runs.
- **Has the day's budget been spent?** Ten runs a day for `explain-episode`; the eleventh becomes a row with status `capped` and a counter, never a silent drop.

Everything the model may see is decided outside it too. The Runs API takes no toolset list, so an API run sees exactly what `platform_toolsets.api_server` allows — the read-only MCP bridge, never the write path.

## The declared use case

One entry of `use-cases.yaml`, mounted from [lares](https://github.com/alexander-zimmermann/lares):

```yaml
use_cases:
  - name: explain-episode
    sentence: Erklärt eine neu aufgetretene oder eskalierte Episode von selbst.
    trigger:
      kind: event
      source: episode
      # event kind → the lowest severity worth a run; a kind left out never runs
      filter:
        appeared: 2
        escalated: 2
    skill: lares-explain
    tools: [lares]
    output: [stored, discord, mail]
    budget:
      tool_calls: 40
      minutes: 10
      runs_per_day: 10
    language: de
    memory: false
    enabled: true
```

A use case either runs (`enabled: true`) or says why it does not (`dormant: <reason>`). There is no `enabled: false` — switching one off without a reason turns the catalogue into a guessing game. A file that does not validate stops the process at startup rather than running a half-read catalogue.

Schema and loader live in this package because the generator renders the harness configuration from the same models: one schema for rendering and for runtime.

## The event path

```

episode.escalated ┼─► durable pull consumer `agent-trigger` on stream EPISODE

                                ▼
                          filter (per use case)

                                │ yes
                                ▼
                   POST /v1/runs   (Idempotency-Key = the ledger key)
                                │
                                ▼
                   GET  /v1/runs/{id} until terminal, or the budget expires
                                │
                                ▼
       UPDATE agent_runs: status, tldr (first line), text, model, tokens,
                          cost, duration, tool_trace = {"tool_count": n}
```

The message is acknowledged once the row is closed, which is why the consumer's `ackWait` has to outlast two of the longest declared budgets plus the retry delay.

## When a run fails

Nothing fails silently. A failed run is retried once when the failure fixes itself, and reported when it does not:

| Class                | Retry | What it is                                                              |
| -------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `rate_limited`       | yes   | 429, a quota throttle.                                                   |
| `timeout`            | yes   | The model source or the harness took too long to answer one call.        |
| `network_error`      | yes   | The harness could not reach the model source.                            |
| `hermes_unreachable` | yes   | The harness itself did not answer, or answered 5xx.                      |
| `interrupted`        | yes   | The gateway restarted before the run settled.                            |
| `credits_exhausted`  | no    | The account is empty; xAI sends it as a 403, so it outranks auth.        |
| `auth_failed`        | no    | A key or token the source refused.                                       |
| `budget_exhausted`   | no    | The run spent its tool calls or its minutes.                             |
| `invalid_config`     | no    | A model, provider or request the gateway does not accept.                |
| `unknown`            | no    | Nothing above matched; the raw error in the alert says what it was.      |
| `trigger_restarted`  | no    | A redelivered event found its row still open: this pod died mid-run.     |

The harness reports a failed run as free text, so the class is read off the text by rules that follow the gateway's own cron classifier. The retry starts after `RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS` on the same row, with `attempt = 2` and its own idempotency key — the ledger key with `/2` appended, because the gateway replays the run it holds for a key it has seen, failed or not.

A run still failed after that closes its row with `status = failed`, `attempt` and the raw `error`, and the trigger posts `AgentRunFailed` straight to Alertmanager's `/api/v2/alerts`:

```json
[{
  "labels": {"alertname": "AgentRunFailed", "use_case": "explain-episode", "severity": "warning"},
  "annotations": {
    "summary": "explain-episode failed on episode 15510:appeared after 2 attempts (rate_limited)",
    "description": "<the raw error, cut at 1024 characters>"
  }
}]
```

There is no `endsAt`, so Alertmanager resolves it after its resolve timeout. An Alertmanager that does not take the post is logged and counted, never retried into a redelivery loop.

A row that a dead pod left `queued` or `running` is not started again when its event is redelivered — the harness may still be working on it — but closed as `trigger_restarted` and reported the same way.

`/healthz` is NATS- and ledger-gated. A harness outage is deliberately not part of it: that is a failed run with its own alert, never a restart loop.

## Tests

One seam, at the service's edges. An episode event goes in on a real NATS container with a real durable consumer; the ledger rows land in a real TimescaleDB container; only the harness and Alertmanager are fakes, over `respx` — the harness because a run is a model call, Alertmanager so the alert is asserted as it would arrive. The failure classes have a table test of their own against the gateway's error texts.

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest
```

Docker is required for the container fixtures.
